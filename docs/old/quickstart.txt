1. Description of model

 This atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) integrates the
 primitive equations of motion and includes an idealized representation
 of the hydrological cycle (Frierson, Zurita-Gotor, and Held 2006 and
 O'Gorman and Schneider 2008).
 The lower boundary condition is an aquaplanet slab ocean (i.e., there
 are no continents), so the surface temperature responds to radiative
 and turbulent surface fluxes.
 The longwave radiation is a gray radiation scheme with a prescribed
 optical depth is a simple function of latitude and pressure. The
 top-of-atmosphere downward shortwave radiation is a function of
 latitude designed to be similar to that of the annual-mean of Earth
 (there is no seasonal or diurnal cycle); atmospheric absorption of
 solar radiation is included as a simple function of pressure.
 Precipitation occurs when resolved motion lead to supersaturation and
 in a sub-grid scale parameterization of convection, based on the
 quasi-equilibrium hypothesis. The parameterization of convection
 relaxes convectively unstable atmospheric columns to a moist
 pseudoadiabatic temperature profile with constant relative humidity
 (see Frierson 2007 and O'Gorman and Schneider 2008 for details). There
 is no condensed water phase in the atmosphere (water is assumed to
 instantaneously return to the surface), and no representation of the
 effect of clouds or water vapor on radiative transfer.

 The dynamical core of the model is the spectral dynamical core
 as described in the public release of idealized spectral models.

2. Acquire the Source Code and Runscripts

 The Flexible Modeling System development team at GFDL uses a local implementation
 of GForge to serve FMS software, located at https://fms.gfdl.noaa.gov/gf
 In order to obtain the source code, you must register as an FMS user on our software server.
 After submitting the registration form on the software server, you should receive an automatically
 generated confirmation email within a few minutes. Clicking on the link in the email confirms the
 creation of your account.

 After your account has been created, you should log in and request access
 to the Idealized Moist Atmospheric Model project. Once the FMS project administrator grants you access,
 you will receive a second e-mail notification. This email requires action on the part
 of the project administrator and thus may take longer to arrive.
 The email will contain a software access password along with instructions for
 obtaining the release package, which are described below.

 You may download the release package from https://fms.gfdl.noaa.gov/gf/project/idealized_moist_atmospheric_model/frs.
 Click on "idealized_moist_atmospheric_model.tar.gz" to download.

3. Run the Model

3.1. The Sample Runscripts

 This release includes compile and run scripts in the exp directory.
 The code and assorted tools used by these scripts are included and are organized into several directories.
 These scripts were developed on the gaea machine at ORNL.

 The compile script:
   * compiles the source code (mppnccombine.c) for a tool that combines distributed model output.
   * executes mkmf, a tool that generates a makefile for compilation of the model code.
   * executes the makefile.

 Adapting the compile script to a different platform will likely require a few modifications.
 The items most likely to need modification are:
   * The modules loaded
   * The command lines to compile mppnccombine.c
   * The compilation template. See the separate discussion of the compilation templates below.

 The run script:
   * creates a working directory where the model will be run.
   * creates or copies the required input data for the model into the working directory.
   * runs the model.
   * combines distributed output and renames the output files using the timestamp.

 Note that the directory and file paths in these scripts are variables. They are initially
 set to correspond to the directory structure as it exists after extraction from the tar file,
 but are made variables to accommodate changes to this directory structure.

3.1.1. The compilation templates

 The scripts use
 the mkmf utility, which creates a Makefile to facilitate compilation. The mkmf
 utility uses a platform-specific template for setting up system and platform
 dependent parameters. Sample templates for various platforms are provided in the
 bin directory. You may need to consult your system administrator to set up a
 compilation template for your platform and ensure the locations for system
 libraries are defined correctly. For documentation on the use of mkmf, see the
 file named "mkmf.html", which is supplied with this package.

3.1.2. The work directory

 The directory path most likely to need changing is workdir.
 workdir is a temporary directory where the model will run. The executable and input
 data is copied into the work directory, and output from the model is also written
 to the work directory. workdir must be large enough to accommodate all of this.

3.2. Grid decomposition

  The spectral model decomposes the horizontal grid into latitude bands with each
band assigned to a processor. When 2 processors are used it is decomposed into
northern and southern hemispheres.
The number of processors that may be used is restricted such that lat_max/npes must be a multiple of 2.
For example, for t42 resolution there are 64 latitudes so that the choices for npes are 1,2,4,8,16,32
  The diagnostic output is distributed, that is, each processor writes its own files.
The processor number is appended to the file name. For example, a diagnostic file named "atmos_daily.nc"
would appear as these four files when npes=4:
atmos_daily.nc.0000
atmos_daily.nc.0001
atmos_daily.nc.0002
atmos_daily.nc.0003

A tool is provided to combine these distributed files into files of data on a single grid.
Combining the four files shown above would result in a single file named "atmos_daily.nc"

===================================================================================

3.3. Restarting and cold-starting

3.3.1. Restarting the model to continue a previous integration

   Restart files are written to a sub-directory, named RESTART, off the working directory.
 Information about the state of the model at the point of termination is contained
 in these files. Each component model and/or sub-component may have restart files.
 To continue a previous integration these files are put in the INPUT directory.
 They are read at initialization to restore the state of the model as it was at
 termination of the previous integration.

3.3.2. Cold-starting the model

   If a component and/or sub-component does not find its restart files in the INPUT
 directory then it performs a default initialization, also referred to as a cold-start.
 The default initialization of each component is required to be compatible with other
 model components, but otherwise is entirely at the discretion of the developer(s). 
   The atmospheric models typically fill the model fields with constant values for a
 cold-start. The result is a model state that is very flat and far away from anything
 scientifically interesting. As a result, a cold-started model needs to be spun-up.
===================================================================================
3.4. Control of model time and length of integration

 The length of integration is set by setting days, hours, minutes and seconds
 in main_nml. The default integration period is zero, so it must be set.

 The model time starts at zero by default. It can be changed by setting current_time
 in main_nml, but this is not recommended. current_time is an array of four elements
 representing days, hours, minutes and seconds. The model time is saved with the
 restart data (in atmos_model.res). Upon restarting, the model time will be read from
 atmos_model.res and any setting via namelist will be ignored. 

 The second line of diag_table is an initial date, by default a string of six zeros. 
 This is the model initial time. The six zeros represent years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
 years and months must be zero. The others should always be equal to what is set for current_time.
 The date in diag_table is intended to be used only for the time axis of the diagnostic output files,
 but unfortunately this standard has not been strictly adhered to. If it is not equal to that
 set for current_time the results are unpredictable.
===================================================================================
3.5. diag_table

 The diagnostic output is controlled via the diagnostics table, which is named "diag_table".
 For documentation on the use of diag_table, see the file named "diag_table.html",
 which is supplied with this package.
===================================================================================
3.6. field_table

 Aside from the model's required prognostic variables; velocity, pressure,
 temperature and humidity, the model may or may not have any number of additional
 tracers. Tracers are advected by the dynamical code, but do not feed back on the
 model solution. Tracers are specified in field_table. For each tracer, the field_table
 specifies the method of advection, convection, and the tracers source and sinks.

 For a more thorough description of field_table, see the file named "field_manager.html",
 which is supplied with this package.
===================================================================================
4. Examine the Output

 You may download sample output data for comparison at:
 ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/perm/pjp/Idealized_Moist_Atmospheric_Model/sample_output.tar.gz
 The size of the sample output, after unzipping, is 671 MB.
 This output was generated on the gaea machine at ORNL.
 The file output.tar.gz contains three directories: ascii, history and restart.
 The ascii directory contains text output of the model including stdout and log messages.
 The history directory contains netCDF diagnostic output, governed by your entries in
 the diag_table. History and ascii files are labeled with the timestamp corresponding to
 the model time at the beginning of execution. The restart directory contains files which
 describe the state of the model at termination. To restart the model running from this
 state, these restart files are moved to the INPUT directory to serve as the initial
 conditions for your next run.
