# Instructions for running Isca on BlueCrystal 3 at Bristol

These instructions are intended to get you up-and-running with a simple Held-Suarez test case. They assume you are starting with a default user environment on BlueCrystal 3, so some changes might be needed if you have already modified your environment.
